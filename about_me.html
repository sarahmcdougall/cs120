    <h2>A Vacation Getaway</h2>
    <p>
        After I finished undergrad, I took a week-long trip up to Acadia National Park
        in Maine. The scenic views were well worth the 8-hour drive from Pennsylvania.
        I spent the week taking on a new hike each day, including Cadillac Mountain. Since that trip,
        I've ventured up to different parts of Maine when I have time (such as Kennebunkport and Portland).
        I can't wait to go back in the summer!

    One of my all-time favorite restaurants is
    <a href="https://www.avocadogrillwpb.com/" target="_blank">Avocado Grill</a>
    in West Palm Beach, Florida. Avocado Grill has an exciting atmosphere with live
    entertainment and beautiful outdoor seating. My favorite dish is
    the tuna poke bowl!

    <p>
        <img src="img/ice_cream.webp" width="150" align="left">
        My all-time favorite food is ice cream. My favorite flavors are chocolate chip cookie
        dough and salted caramel! I also really enjoy pineapple soft-serve, although it is a lot more
        difficult to come by.
