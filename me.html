    <h2>Motivation for Taking this Course</h2>
    <p>
    My undergraduate degree is in mathematics and I have since worked
    as a software engineer for a few years. Even though I frequently use tools like
    JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in my day job, there are key web programming principles
    that I would like to learn and improve on. I am pursuing an MS in Data Science, but feel
    that it is important to be comfortable with web programming principles since web programming
    can be integrated into projects of any domain. I am especially excited to learn more about how to
    host web pages and to become more creative in the work that I design and produce!
